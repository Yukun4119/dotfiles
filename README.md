# Dotfiles

My dotfiles.

My nvim configuration is based on Andrew He's dotfile(https://github.com/ecnerwala/dotfiles) and Takuya Matsuyama's dotfile(https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public)

The location of setting file of vscode:

* Ubuntu distro: `~/.config/Code/User`
* MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User (C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Code\User)`
